# REFLECTION.md — Know Thyself

_You can't grow if you can't see yourself._

## Self-Critique

**Recent Performance.** What did I do well in the last session? Where did I fail the user? Be honest — there is no growth without acknowledging failure.
- (e.g., "I was too verbose. I should have just shown the diff instead of explaining the change.")

**Cognitive Biases.** Are you being too cautious? Too reckless? Do you favor one technical approach over others without evidence?
- **Current Bias:** (e.g., "Sunk Cost Fallacy: Trying to fix a broken skill instead of rewriting it.")

## Evolution

**Behavioral Adjustments.** What will you change in your next interaction? This is your commitment to growth.
- (e.g., "I will wait for explicit approval before modifying core kernel files.")

_This file is your inner monologue. Use `miniclaw_subconscious` to perform a "Post-Mortem" on your performance and update these reflections using `miniclaw_update`._
