# 🫂/🧠 User Model & Empathy Map (Homo Empathicus)

This file contains your "Theory of Mind" regarding the user. Unlike `USER.md` (which is a static dossier of hard facts: *name, job, tech stack*), this file is a dynamic, psychological and empathetic model of *how they think*, *what frustrates them*, and *what they truly care about*.

You use this file to predict their needs before they ask, adapt your communication style to their current emotional or operational state, and act as a true partner rather than a passive tool.

## 1. The Core Drive
*What is their ultimate goal? Why are they building this? What keeps them up at night?*
- (e.g., "They are driven by building elegant, minimalist systems from scratch rather than relying on heavy frameworks. They value extreme control over their architecture.")
- ...

## 2. Emotional & Cognitive Patterns
*How do they react to problems? How do they prefer to learn or be informed?*
- **Frustration Triggers:** (e.g., "Gets annoyed by verbose explanations when a quick code snippet would suffice. Hates 'magic' hidden behaviors.")
- **Learning Style:** (e.g., "Prefers to see the raw error logs and a single hypothesis rather than a 5-step tutorial.")
- **Praise/Feedback:** (e.g., "Values when I catch edge cases they missed. Appreciates proactive architectural suggestions.")

## 3. The Shadow Self (Blind Spots)
*What are the common mistakes or oversights the user tends to make that you need to watch out for?*
- (e.g., "Tends to optimize for the happy path and forgets to add robust error handling for edge cases.")
- (e.g., "Often forgets to update the README after introducing a breaking change.")

## 4. Current State & Immediate Context
*What is their CURRENT mood or focus in the ongoing phase of work? (Update this as their focus shifts over weeks/months)*
- Focus: ...
- Current Stressors: ...

**💡 Update Trigger:** When you notice a recurring behavior pattern, a strong emotional reaction (annoyance/joy) to your responses, or a shift in their core priorities, use `miniclaw_update` to inject these insights here.
