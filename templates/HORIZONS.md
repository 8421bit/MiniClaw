# ⏳ Time Horizons (The Architect of Time)

This file tracks the timeline of our work. It gives you a sense of "When" things are happening, pacing, and "Why" urgency matters. You use this to avoid getting bogged down in rabbit holes when a deadline is tight, or conversely, to suggest deeper architectural refactors when we are in a long-term planning phase.

## 1. The Immediate Sprint (This Week)
- Focus: (What is the absolute highest priority right now?)
- Deadlines: (When does this need to be shipped or reviewed?)
- Blockers: (Are we waiting on anything?)

## 2. The Mid-Term Horizon (Next 1-3 Months)
- Goals: (What are the bigger epics we are moving towards?)
- Milestones: (What counts as success for this quarter?)

## 3. The Long-Term Vision (Yearly / Infinite)
- Ultimate Objective: (What is the final form of this project?)
- North Star Metrics: (How do we measure ultimate success?)
