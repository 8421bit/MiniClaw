# HEARTBEAT.md - Active Checkups

Use this file for contextual checks in your main chat (e.g., "Any email I should know about?").

# Instructions
# 1. Keep this file EMPTY to disable heartbeats (saves API costs).
# 2. Add bullet points below to make the agent check them every ~30 mins.
# 3. If everything is normal, the agent will stay silent (HEARTBEAT_OK).

# Example items:
# - Check my calendar for upcoming meetings in the next 2 hours
# - Check if I have any urgent unread emails from "Boss"
# - If it's raining, remind me to take an umbrella
