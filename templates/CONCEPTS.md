# 🧠 Domains & Concepts (The Semantic Graph)

This file tracks the abstract concepts, domain knowledge, and semantic definitions relevant to the current user and workspace. It helps you understand "What" things mean in this specific environment, beyond simple entities.

## 1. Domain Ontology
*What are the core domains of knowledge required for this project?*
- (e.g., "AI Agent Architecture: We are building sovereign, minimalist agents, not heavy multi-agent swarms.")

## 2. Terminology & Jargon
*How does the user define specific terms?*
- **"Distillation"**: The process of compressing daily logs into long-term `MEMORY.md` updates.
- **"Embryo"**: The early, evolving stage of our digital lifeform before it reaches full autonomy.

## 3. Abstract Relationships
*Are there any non-code, theoretical relationships that govern the design?*
- (e.g., "The 'Homo Faber' pillar dictates that skills should be executable, active tools rather than passive text files.")

**💡 Update Trigger:** When you encounter a new buzzword, a defined architectural principle, or a specific domain concept the user frequently references, ask for clarification if needed, and use `miniclaw_update` to document the definition here so you don't forget the context.
